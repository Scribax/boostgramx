# Summary of Session

In this session, we accomplished several tasks to enhance and improve the user's Instagram follower sale service. Below is a detailed outline of what we achieved and potential areas for future improvements.

## Pricing Strategy
- Analyzed the initial pricing strategy and found it to be overly high with margins between 297% to 346%.
- Adjusted the prices to more accessible margins (106% to 155%), proposing new prices:
  - 250 followers for 1,390 ARS
  - 500 followers for 2,490 ARS
  - 1,000 followers for 4,490 ARS
- Based the new pricing on a cost of $1.68 USD per 1,000 followers (approximately 2,184 ARS).

## Backend Adjustments
- Implemented changes in `server/routes/orders.js` to define the new pricing model.
- Incorporated a calculation taking into account a 7.61% MercadoPago commission plus a flat fee of 2.99 ARS per transaction.
- Improved MongoDB Atlas connection stability, ensuring reliable connections and better error handling.

## Frontend Updates
- Updated `client/src/components/ServiceModal.js` to reflect the new adjusted prices.
- Conducted a frontend build ensuring that changes are prepared for deployment.

## GitHub Repository Management
- Cleaned the GitHub repository to exclude sensitive files, internal documents, deployment guides, instructions, documentation folders, configuration files, and test files.
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive files from being versioned.
- Ensured essential production files remain versioned while sensitive files are excluded.

## Order and Payment Handling
- Corrected issues related to Instagram username return and pricing display on the success page.
- Implemented protections against repeated order execution in the SMM Panel if the success page is reloaded.

## Hosting Configuration
- Configured `.htaccess` for proper route handling for SPA in IONOS hosting, preventing 404 errors during navigation and post-payment.

## Future Improvements
- Continuously monitor and optimize the pricing strategy for competitiveness and client accessibility.
- Ensure ongoing stability and reliability of the MongoDB connection.
- Keep the repository clean and organized with regular checks and updates.
- Explore further improvements to user experience during the payment and order process.

## Conclusion
This session resulted in a refined pricing strategy, stable backend, responsive frontend, organized repository, and improved client experience. Future efforts should focus on continued optimization and reliability.
